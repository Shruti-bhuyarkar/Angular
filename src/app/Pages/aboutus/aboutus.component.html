<h4>You used an absolute path instead of a relative path, or vice versa. An absolute path starts from the root directory (/) and specifies the exact location of the directory. A relative path starts from the current working directory and specifies the location of the directory relative to it. You can use the pwd command to print the current working directory. For example, if you are in /home/user and you want to change to /home/user/src/app/pages, you can use either cd src/app/pages (relative path) or cd /home/user/src/app/pages (absolute path), but not cd /src/app/pages (wrong absolute path).</h4>
